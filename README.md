# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

My motivation behind this prework study guide was to use this as a reference point for where I have started my web development journey. This prework study guide is packed with useful information for myself and others to guide them through the eartly stages as they adapt and gain confidence. 
During building this guide I have encountered a number of issues that were solved via troubleshooting and taking a step back to review everything. I came across merging erros with my local terminal and GitHub but I managed to do thorough reseach to rectify these problems.
I am so surpised by how much I have learnt in such a short period of time already, which has thus given me even more confidence and drive for whats to come in the bootcamp. From a complete beginner learning terminology and actually rememebering commands has been extremely exciting.
I now have built a prework study guide from scratch using HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. All of my work documentation has been logged on GitHub so there is a clear timeline of everything that has been completed.
